## PHP OOP Topics
- constructor
- destructor
- constant & `self::`
- `this` keyword
- access modifiers (`public`/`private`/`protected`)
- inheritance
- override methods
- override properties
- include a class file
- final keyword to prevent overriding
- calling parent constructor in child class (`parent::`)
- static variables (`self::$cnt`)
- static method (`classname::function` as it belongs to the class & is shared along all methods)
- abstract class (no objects only inheritance)
- abstract methods
- final class (no inheritance from this class)
